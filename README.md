# How to install FREESTOR:
___________________________
-copy all files from [RELEASES](https://github.com/GorGylka/FREESTOR/releases) to root of your memory card ms0:/

-install Npdrm_free plugin on your PSP (https://github.com/lusid1/npdrm_free_mod)

(if you install npdrm_free_mod, and get 80010087 error, try this plugin instead (https://github.com/qwikrazor87/npdrm_free) )

<details>
  <summary>HOW TO INSTALL npdrm_free_mod Plugin (click on me)</summary>
  
  -If you have PSP 1000/2000/3000 or PÕüSÕüPÕü GÕüOÕü WÕüÕüÕüIÕüÕüÕüTÕüÕüÕüHÕüÕüÕü MÕüeÕümÕüoÕürÕüyÕü CÕüaÕürÕüdÕü
  
     -Place npdrm_free_mod.prx in ms0:/seplugins folder
  
     -Add line (without quotes) "ms0:/seplugins/npdrm_free_mod.prx 1" to ms0:/seplugins/vsh.txt AND ms0:/seplugins/game.txt
  
     -Reboot your PSP
  
  -If you have PSP Go WITHOUT memory card use this plugin instead ----> [npdrm_free](https://github.com/qwikrazor87/npdrm_free)
  
     -Place npdrm_free.prx in ef0:/seplugins folder
  
     -Add line (without quotes) "ef0:/seplugins/npdrm_free.prx 1" to ef0:/seplugins/vsh.txt AND ef0:/seplugins/game.txt
  
     -Reboot your PSP

 -Only for PSP go owners, to make PS1 games work (thanks to RazorStrike)
 
      -Download Popsloader (Google it)
      
      -The zip has SEPLUGINS folder, with POPS.txt and POPSLOADER inside. Copy POPSLOADER folder into ef0:/seplugins/
      
      -Edit the ef0:/seplugins/POPS.txt, add lines 
      
      ef0:/seplugins/popsloader/popsloader.prx 1
      ef0:/seplugins/popsloader/cdda_enabler.prx 1
      
      -Restart the console
      
      -Start the PS1 game holding R. It should open a menu with all Popsloader firmwares, 
      you can choose 1 and it will apply and start the game.
      After that you won't need to do that again, unless the game isn't compatible with the selected firmware,
      but can be changes the same way by holding R when starting the game.

# How to use:

Run FREESTOR, choose game, then press X to download and install pkg. That's it.
___________________________
# Limitations:

-PSP Wifi Does not support new Encryption Standarts, so to use it, change Wifi encryption from WPA2-PSK to WPA-PSK , WEP or just disable password in your wifi router settings. If you change the protection from WPA2-PSK to WPA-PSK and keep the same password, you will be able to connect your PSP and you wont need to pair already connected devices.

-Maximum download speed is about Ã∂2Ã∂0Ã∂0Ã∂-Ã∂3Ã∂0Ã∂0Ã∂kÃ∂bÃ∂/Ã∂sÃ∂  450-600kb/s due to outdated Wifi module. 

| File Size | Downloading & Installation time |
| --- | --- |
| 100 MB | ‚âà 7 min. |
| 200 MB | ‚âà 15 min. |
| 500 MB | ‚âà 35 min. |
| 1000 MB | ‚âà 1 hour |
| 1500 MB | ‚âà 1 hour, 30 min. |

 In view of the fact that most have old, weak batteries, I highly recommend installing games with the charger connected.

-FreeStor conflicts with Autostart.prx and category_lite.prx plugins. turn it off, if you use FreeStor

-PSP Street not supported at all
