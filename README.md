This app allows download and install PSP .pkg directly via WiFi, without PC. 

# Installing
* copy all files from (releases) to root of your memory card ms0:/

* install Npdrm_free plugin on your PSP (https://github.com/lusid1/npdrm_free_mod)

* to prevent shutdown during download process, disable Auto Sleep (PSP Settings ‚û°Ô∏è Power Save Settings ‚û°Ô∏è Auto Sleep ‚û°Ô∏è off)

# How to use

Run FREESTOR, choose game, then press X to download and install pkg. That's it.

# Limitations

* PSP's Wi-Fi may not support your router's settings. If you can't connect to your home network, change by yourself or ask an admin to change Wi-Fi encryption from WPA2-PSK only to "WPA/WPA2-PSK", "WPA-PSK", WEP or just disable password at all (which is not secure, of course)

* Maximum download speed is about 450-600kb/s due to outdated Wi-Fi module. Downloading and installing a 500MB game takes approximately 35 minutes

* Of course PSP Street is not supported due to the missing Wireless module

# TO DO List

* ~~Wrap two apps into one~~

* ~~increase  download speed from 250 to 500 kb/s~~

* ~~Add PS1 library~~

* Replace one of the system apps (such as Digital Comics) with a Freeshop app

* Test it on PSP Go
